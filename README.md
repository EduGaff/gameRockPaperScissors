## How to Run the Game
Run the game online at gaff.epizy.com, it can be played by anyone.


## Future
List of initiatives that I may take to make the game even better:
- [] Hide last `<p>` and show it only after the first round;
- [] Add a button to reset the score;
- [] Add an icon next to the score when a round is played, making more explicit to the player what his and the computer options are chosen;


## Contributions
Every contribution will be welcome, although I don't think anyone would waste their time helping me with this project.


## Bugs
There are no bugs, my coding is perfect. Even though I'm a newbie on coding anything.
